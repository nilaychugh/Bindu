OVERVIEW
--------
This release focuses on reducing installation footprint by making heavy agent frameworks
optional dependencies, and improving authentication configuration for public endpoints.

Dependency Optimization:
- Moved agent frameworks to optional [agents] extra
  - agno, langchain, langgraph, ollama, duckduckgo-search now optional

- Improved auth middleware configuration clarity

Release Process:

Code Quality:
- Removed static file paths from public endpoints configuration
- Updated secrets baseline
