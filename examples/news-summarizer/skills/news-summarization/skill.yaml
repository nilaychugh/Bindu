documentation:
  overview: |
    This skill enables the agent to fetch and summarize latest news on any
    topic. Unlike static summarization, this skill actively searches the web
    for current information using DuckDuckGo, then uses a local Llama 3.2
    model to produce structured summaries — completely free and private.

  use_cases:
    when_to_use:
      - User asks for latest news on any topic
      - User wants current events summarized
      - User needs quick news briefing

    when_not_to_use:

      - User needs historical data analysis
      - User needs real-time live scores (latency too high)
